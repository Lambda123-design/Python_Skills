   (v) Dynamic Typing

(III) . **Data Types:**
   (i) Basic Data Types: int, float, boolean, str
   (ii) Type Conversion

(IV) . **Operators:**
   (i) Arithmetic Operators - Addition, Multiplication, Division, Floor Divison, Modulus, Exponential
   (ii) Comparison Operators - Equal to, Not equal to, Greater than, Lesser than, Greater than or equal to, Lesser than or equal to

2. **File Handling**:

   (i) File Operation - With Open (r-Read, w-Write,a-Append,wb-WriteBytes,w+ - Read and Write); file.write,file.writelines, file.seek(0) - Takes the cursor to the beginning while read and write.
   
   (ii) Working with File Paths - mkdir - Make Directory, listdir - List Directory, getcwd - Current Working Directory, path.exists - Check if path exists, .isfile - Check if it is a file, .isdir - Check if it is a directory, path.abspath - Gives Absolute path
