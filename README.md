Following are my Python Skills:

1. **Basics Python:**

  (i) Syntax and Semantics
  
  (ii) Single and Multi Line Commands

(B). **Variables:**
   (i) Declaring and Assigning Variables
   
   (ii) Naming Conventions
   
   (iii) Variable Types
   
   (iv) Type Checking and Conversion
   
   (v) Dynamic Typing

(C) . **Data Types:**
   (i) Basic Data Types: int, float, boolean, str
   (ii) Type Conversion

(D) . **Operators:**
   (i) Arithmetic Operators - Addition, Multiplication, Division, Floor Divison, Modulus, Exponential
   (ii) Comparison Operators - Equal to, Not equal to, Greater than, Lesser than, Greater than or equal to, Lesser than or equal to
   (iii) Logical Operators - AND, OR, NOT

(E). **Conditional Statements:**
   (i) if statement

   (ii) while Loop
   (iii) Loop Control Statements: break, continue, pass
   (iv) Nested Loops

2. **File Handling**:

   (i) File Operation - With Open (r-Read, w-Write,a-Append,wb-WriteBytes,w+ - Read and Write); file.write,file.writelines, file.seek(0) - Takes the cursor to the beginning while read and write.
   
   (ii) Working with File Paths - mkdir - Make Directory, listdir - List Directory, getcwd - Current Working Directory, path.exists - Check if path exists, .isfile - Check if it is a file, .isdir - Check if it is a directory, path.abspath - Gives Absolute path

3. **Exception Handling**:

  (i) Try, Except Block
  
  (ii) Try, Except, Else Block
